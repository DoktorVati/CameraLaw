            <h2>Bankruptcy Law Expertise</h2>
            <p>
                With nearly a decade of dedicated experience in bankruptcy law, I specialize in Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases, providing compassionate and strategic guidance to clients in financial distress. My journey began as a paralegal and extern, where I honed my skills over six years, allowing me to seamlessly transition into a practicing role.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my two years as a practicing attorney, I have successfully navigated over 75 Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases, focusing on helping individuals reorganize their debts and regain financial stability. Additionally, I've handled around 200 Chapter 7 cases, utilizing my in-depth knowledge to ensure a smooth process for clients seeking debt relief.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am committed to understanding each client's unique situation and tailoring solutions that best fit their needs, always striving to empower them on their path to financial recovery. With a blend of experience, empathy, and expertise, I work diligently to demystify the bankruptcy process and achieve positive outcomes for those I represent.
