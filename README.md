# CameraLaw
This is a prototype demo representing what was made for Camera law.

Led the development and design of a multi-page interactive prototype website to provide the law firm with a visual representation of potential design ideas to guide their final decisions.

Consulted and prototyped web designs closely with the law firm to ensure client- developer synchronicity.
